In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  If the renderItem function performs expensive operations or updates state frequently, it can lead to significant performance issues, including dropped frames, janky scrolling, and even crashes. This is often exacerbated if the `keyExtractor` function is inefficient or improperly implemented, causing React Native to struggle to track and update items efficiently.  The issue may manifest as intermittent freezes or unresponsiveness, especially on lower-end devices.
